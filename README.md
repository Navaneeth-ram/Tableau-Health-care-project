# Tableau Healthcare Dashboard: Exploring Hospital Performance Metrics
Within my Tableau healthcare dashboard, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of key performance metrics in the hospital setting. The dashboard specifically focuses on the following areas:

Length of Stay in Hospital: Through interactive visualizations, I have examined and presented insights into the duration patients spend within the hospital, allowing for a better understanding of patient care efficiency.

Readmissions: The dashboard sheds light on the frequency and patterns of patient readmissions, providing a valuable perspective on the effectiveness of care transitions and post-discharge management.

Emergency Department Throughput: I've analyzed and visualized the flow of patients through the emergency department, enabling an assessment of operational efficiency and potential bottlenecks.

Mortality Analysis: By visualizing mortality rates and trends, the dashboard aids in identifying areas for potential improvement in patient care and outcomes.

Ambulatory Visits: Through interactive graphs, I've explored the number and characteristics of ambulatory visits, offering insights into outpatient services utilization.

Hypertension Management: The dashboard provides an overview of hypertension management, including treatment approaches and their impact on patient outcomes.
